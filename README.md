# Yarn v3 Berry - Monorepo MFE Prototype Scaffolding

The problem: You have a monorepo you want to manage with `Yarn`. But individual projects use differing versions of a dependency. This can lead to conflicts and
errors.

In a perfect repository, your projects would all have the same versions of core tools like, `react` and `@types/react`. But perhaps you have a project that is
transitioning MFE and you need them to all act as one cohesive project.

This prototype repository explores one specific scaffolding solution to this problem using Yarn (v3) Berry
